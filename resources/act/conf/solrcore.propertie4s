#If the configuration directory for a Solr core contains a file named solrcore.properties that file can #contain
#any arbitrary user defined property names and values using the Java standard properties file format, and #those
#properties can be used as variables in the XML configuration files for that Solr core.
#For example, the following solrcore.properties file could be created in the conf/ directory of a #collection
#using one of the example configurations, to override the lockType used.
#conf/solrcore.properties
#solr.lock.type=none
